Once upon a time there was a man named Bill. Bill lived in a house all the way on top of a mountain. One day, Bill decided to walk all the way down the mountain, something he rarely did. While walking down the mountain, he saw something strange. He saw an injured  snake on the road. The snake asked for help, Bill is a good guy so he took it home and cure it.
