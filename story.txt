Once upon a time there was a man named Bill. Bill lived in a house all the way on top of a mountain. One day, Bill decided to walk all the way down the mountain, something he rarely did. While walking down the mountain, he saw something strange. He saw an injured  snake on the road. The snake asked for help, Bill is a good guy so he took it home and cure it.

Little did he know, the snake was poisonous. As soon as Bill brought the snake back into his home, he realized that the snake was faking its injury, and began to attack him. 
Bill tried to fight back with a kitchen knife, but the snake was too fast and bit him on his arm.
Bill started to feel an intense pain running up his arm. He had to do something! He decided to try to roll down the hill and get to the nearby town.

But Bill couldn't roll because the ground was covered in poison ivy. So Bill just decided to call 911 to get an ambulance to pick him up and drive him to the hospital.
